## About Me

I am a Ph.D. student in Computer Science at the [University of Missouri](https://engineering.missouri.edu/departments/eecs/), advised by [Dr. Tanu Malik](https://engineering.missouri.edu/faculty/tanu-malik/).

My research focuses on **Efficiency in LLMs**, **Trustworthy AI**, and **Reproducibility in Systems**.

In Summer 2026, I will join **Microsoft** as a Research Data Science Intern.

Previously, I completed my M.S. in Computer Science at Missouri, advised by [Dr. Jianlin Cheng](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jianlin_Cheng) and [Dr. Grant Scott](https://scottgs.mufaculty.umsystem.edu/). I received my B.Tech from VIT Vellore, where I worked on multilingual sentiment analysis advised by Dr. Soughbhagya Barpanda, with dataset and collaboration support from [Dr. P. Kumaraguru](https://www.iiit.ac.in/people/faculty/pk/) (PRECOG, IIIT Hyderabad).

I was selected as a **Google PhD Fellowship Nominee (2025)** in NLP, one of three nominees from Missouri, and received the **Outstanding Master's Student Award (2025)**.

**Research Interests:** LLMs, NLP, Agentic AI, Trustworthy AI, Scalable ML Systems, Reproducibility
